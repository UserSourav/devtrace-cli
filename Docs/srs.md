## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
DevTrace is an Automated Traceability and Developer Experience (DX) platform designed to bridge the gap between project planning and software execution. While Jira is used for requirement management and Git for code development, traceability between them is often weak.

DevTrace provides seamless, real-time integration between Jira and Git, automatically linking code commits to Jira tickets. It visualizes development activity in a structured traceability tree and enhances developer productivity by eliminating manual tagging and reporting.

---

### 1.2 Document Conventions
- **Bold text** indicates key terms and system components  
- `Monospace font` represents commands, APIs, and code references  
- Numbered sections indicate hierarchical organization  
- Diagrams and tables are labeled and cross-referenced  

---

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for:
- **Project Managers** – traceability, progress tracking, compliance  
- **Software Developers** – system workflows and validations  
- **QA Engineers/Testers** – verification and dependency analysis  
- **System Architects** – scalability and architectural assessment  

---

### 1.4 Product Scope
DevTrace is a middleware-based traceability platform that:
- Automatically links Git commits to Jira tickets  
- Visualizes real-time development activity  
- Enforces compliance via Git hooks  
- Detects risks such as shadow work and scope creep  
- Uses a modular architecture (CLI, API, UI)  
- Supports incremental development  

DevTrace does not replace Jira or Git; it enhances them.
